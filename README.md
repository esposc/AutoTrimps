> Due to a myriad of reasons, I am finding it difficult to keep this project on my plate. Thus, it is unfortunately my decision that I have to put this project on hold. While I would still be around to tackle things that I can fix in under a minute, like writing a short script to pause the script at zone X for you, I don't have the time to add features as I would had liked. It seems that there is a new fork maintained: https://github.com/coderpatsy/AutoTrimps While I have not used it to vow for its reliability, there is that option.

Based on AutoTrimp-genBTC. Modified by Uni. <b>Not backwards compatible with AutoTrimps-genBTC due to optimized save format! Please beware and backup your AT configs!</b> Also, not guarranteed the work. The reason why I'm building a fork instead of submitting PRs is that I have no idea how it really works and need a way to crash test. Also I don't want to hold other maintainers from having to deal with the technical debt I cause. If any horrible code I wrote gets in your way, sorry!

<del>I'm usually on zininzinin's AT chat. If I'm not online there or if you just want to yell at me about the script without any interference just PM me.</del>

## Current Roadmap
- Implement stuff that I want to see which isn't already in genBTC
- Implement changes that others have requested and I feel are doable
- Fix problems that were around in AT but wasn't resolved

## Script Installation
**Please backup your game via export before and during use to prevent losing your save due to corruption!**

**Please also backup your AT config, it will be converted into simplified format which is a NO RETURN PROCESS!**
